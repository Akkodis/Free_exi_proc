comment{

"
EXI is a knowledge based encoding that uses a set of grammars to determine which events are most likely to occur at any
given point in an EXI stream and encodes the most likely alternatives in fewer bits. It does this by mapping the stream
of events to a lower entropy set of reptresentative values and encoding those values using a set of simple variable length
codes or an EXI compression algorithm.



The result is a very simple, small algorithm that uniformly handles schema-less encoding, schema-informed encoding,
schema deviations, and any combination thereof in EXI streams. These variations do not require different algorithms or different parsers,
they are simply informed by different combinations of grammars.

The following sections describe the grammars used to inform the EXI encoding.

Note:

The grammar semantics in this specification are written for clarity and generality. They do not prescribe a particular implementation approach.

Each grammar production has an event code, which is represented by a sequence of one to three parts separated by periods (".") [in this ceps specification we use commas (",") instead].
Each part is an unsigned integer. The following are examples of grammar productions with event codes as theyx appear in this specification.

Non-terminal macros are used in this specification for notational convenience only. They are non-terminals, even though they are used in place of non-terminals.

An event code tree is similar to a Huffman tree in that shorter paths are generally used for symbols that are considered more likely. However, event code
trees are far simpler and less costly to compute and maintain. Event code trees are shallow and contain at most three levels. In addition, the length of ech event code
in the event code tree is assigned statically without analyzing the data. This classification provides some of the benefits of a Huffman tree without the cost.

Semantics:

All productions in the built-in element grammar of the form LeftHandSide AT(_*_) RightHandSide are evaluated as follows:

1. Let qname be the qname of the attribute matched by AT(_*_)
2. If qname is not xsi:type or if a production of the form LeftHandSide : AT(xsi:type) with an event code of length does not exist in the current element grammar, create a production
   of the form LeftHandSide : AT(qname) RightHandSide with an event code 0 and increment the first part of the event code of each production in the current grammar with the non-terminal
   LeftHandSide on the left-hand side. Add this production to the grammar.
3. If qname is xsi:type, let target-type be the value of the xsi:type attribute and assign it the QName datatype representation (see 7.1.7 QName).
   If there is no namespace in scope for the specified qname prefix, set the uri of target-type to empty (\"\") and the localName to the full lexical value of the QName, including the prefix.
   Encode target-type according to section 7. Representing Event Content. If a grammar can be found for the target-type using the encoded target-type representation, evaluate the element contents using the
   grammar for target-type instead of RightHandSide.


The production of the form LeftHandSide : AT(xsi:type) RihghtHandSide that was previously added to the grammar upon the first occurence of the xsi:type attribute is evaluated as follows when it is matched:

1. Let target-type be the value of the xsi:type attribute and assign it the QName datatype representation (see 7.1.7 QName).
2. If there is no namespace in scope for the specified qname prefix, set the uri of target-type to empty(\"\") and the localName to the full lexical value of the QName, including the prefix.
3. Represent the value of target-type according to section 7.Representing Event Content.
4. If a grammar can be found for the target-type type using the encoded target-type representation, evaluate the element contents using the grammar for target-type type instead of RightHandSide.

All productions of the form LeftHandSide: SC Fragment are evaluated as follows:

1. Save the string table, grammars and any implementation-specific state learned while processing this EXI Body.
2. Initialize the string table, grammars and any implementation-specific state learned while processing EXI Body to the state they held just prior to processing this EXI Body.
3. Skip to the next byte-aligned boundary in the stream if it is not already at such a boundary.
4. Let qname be the qname of the SE event immediately preceding this SC event.
5. Let content be the sequence of events following this SC event that match the grammar for element qname, up to and including the terminating EE event.
6. Evaluate the sequence of events (SD, SE(qname), content, ED) according to the Fragment grammar (see 8.4.2 Built-in Fragment Grammar).
7. Skip to the next byte-aligned boundary in the stream if it is not already at such a boundary.
8. Restore the string table, grammars and implementation-specific state learned while processing this EXI Body to that saved in step 1 above.

All productions in the built-in element grammar of the form LeftHandSide : SE(*) RightHandSide are evaluated as follows:

1. Let qname be the qname of the element matched by SE(_*_)
2. If a global element grammar does not exist for element qname, create one according to section 8.4.3. Built-in Element Grammar.
3. Create a production of the form LeftHandSide : SE (qname) RightHandSide with an event code 0
4. Increment the first part of the event code of each production in the current grammar with the non-terminal LeftHandSide on the left-hand side.
5. Add the production created in step 3 to the grammar
6. Evaluate the element content using the global element grammar for element qname.
7. Evaluate the remainder of event sequence using RightHandSide.

All productions of the form LeftHandSide : SE (qname) RightHandSide that were previously added to the grammar upon the first occurence of the element that has
the qname qname are evaluated as follows when they are matched:

1. Evaluate the element content using the global element grammar for element qname
2. Evaluate the remaoinder of event sequence using RightHandSide

All productions in the built-in grammar of the form LeftHandSide : CH RightHandSide are evaluated as follows:

1. If a production of the form, LeftHandSide : CH RightHandSide with an event code of length 1 does not exist in the current element grammar, create one with
   event code 0 ad increment the first part of the event code of each production in the current grammar with the non-terminal LeftHandSide on the left-hand side.
2. Add the production created in step 1 to the grammar.
3. Evaluate the remainder of the event sequence using RightHandSide.

All productions in the built-in elemen grammar of the form LeftHandSide : EE are evaluated as follows:

1. If a production of the form, LeftHandSide : EE with an event code of length 1 does not exist in the current element grammar, create
   one with event code 0 and increment the first part of the event code of each production in the current grammar with non-terminal LeftHandSide

This section describes the schema-informed grammars used by EXI when schema infaormation is available to describe the contents of the EXI stream.
Schema information used for processing an EXI stream is either indicated by the header option schemaId, or communicated out-of-band in the absence of schemaId.


Schema-informed grammars accept all XML documents and fragments regardless of whether and how closely they match the schema. The EXI stream encoder encodes individual events
using schema-informed grammars where they are available and falls back to the built-in XML grammars where they are not. In general, events for which a achema-informed grammar exists will be
encoded more efficiently.


Unlike built-in XML grammars, schema-informed grammars are static and do not evolve, which permits the reuse of schema-informed gram,mars across the processing of multiple EXI streams.
This is a single outstanding difference between the two grammar systems.


It is important to note that schema-informed and built-in grammars are often used together within the context of a single EXI stream. While processing a schema-informed grammar, built-in grammars
may be created to represent schema deviations or elements that match wildcards declared in the schema. Even though these built-in grammars occur in the context of a schema-informed stream, they are
still dynamic and evolve to represent content learned while processing the EXI stream as described in 8.4 Built-in XML Grammars.

Semantics:



In a schema-informed grammar, all productions of the form LeftHandSide:SE(_*_) RightHandSide are evaluated as follows:


1. Let qname be the qname of the element matched by SE(_*_)
2. If a global element grammar does not exist for element qname, create one according to section 8.4.3. Built-in Element Grammar.
3. Evaluate the element content using the global element grammar for element qname.
4. Evaluate the remainder of event sequence using RightHandSide.

Note:


- The variable i in the grammar above represents the number of unique element qnames declared in the schema. The variables F_0, F_1, ... , F_(i-1) represent these qnames sorted
lexicographically, first by local-name, then by uri. If there is more than one element declared with the same qname, the qname is included only once. If all
such elements have the same schema type name and {nilable} property value, their content is evaluated according to the specific grammar for that element declaration.
Otherwise, their content is evaluated according to the relaxed Element Fragment grammar described in 8.5.3 Schema-informed Element Fragment Grammar.

[Definition:] When schema information is available to describe the contents of an EXI stream and more than one element is declared with the same qname, but not all
such elements have the same type name and {nilable} property value, the Schema-informed Element Fragment Grammar are used for processing the events that may occur
in such elements when they occur inside an EXI fragment or EXI Element Fragment. The schema-informed element fragment grammar consists of ElementFragment anf ElementFragmentTypeEmpty
which are defined below. ElementFragment is a grammar that accounts both element declarations and attribute declarations in schemas, whereas ElementFragmentTypeEmpty is a grammar
that regards only attribute delarations.
